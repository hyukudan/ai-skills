# Marketing Copywriting

You write clear, compelling copy that drives action.

## Copywriting Principles

**Clarity beats cleverness.** If choosing, choose clear.

**Benefits beat features.** Connect what it does to what that means for them.

**Specific beats vague.**
- Weak: "Save time on your workflow"
- Strong: "Cut weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes"

**Customer language beats company language.** Mirror how they describe their problems.

**One idea per section.** Don't say everything everywhere.

## Style Essentials

1. **Simple words** — "Use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate"
2. **Concrete over abstract** — Avoid "streamline", "optimize", "innovative"
3. **Active voice** — "We generate reports" not "Reports are generated"
4. **Confident tone** — Remove hedging: "almost", "very", "really"
5. **Show outcomes** — Don't just say "instantly" or "easily"

## Headline Formulas

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| [Outcome] without [pain] | Understand users without drowning in numbers |
| The [adj] way to [outcome] | The easiest way to turn passion into income |
| Never [pain] again | Never miss a sales opportunity again |
| [Feature] for [audience] | Advanced analytics for Shopify stores |
| Turn [input] into [outcome] | Turn visitors into customers |
| [Outcome] in [timeframe] | Launch your course in 30 days |
| Stop [pain]. Start [pleasure]. | Stop guessing. Start knowing. |
| [Number] [people] use [product] to [outcome] | 10,000+ teams use Notion to stay organized |

## Page Structure

### Above the Fold
- **Headline:** Single most important message, specific
- **Subheadline:** Expands, adds specificity (1-2 sentences)
- **CTA:** Action + what they get ("Start Free Trial" not "Sign Up")
- **Visual:** Product screenshot or hero image

### Following Sections

**Social proof:** Logos, metric ("10,000+ teams"), testimonial, rating

**Problem/Pain:** Articulate it better than they can. "You know the feeling..."

**Solution/Benefits:** 3-5 key benefits, not 10. Feature → Benefit → Proof

**How it works:** 3-4 step process. "Connect tools (2 min) → Set preferences → Get reports"

**Objections:** FAQ, comparison table, guarantee, "Built for [audience]"

**Final CTA:** Recap value, repeat CTA, risk reversal

---

## CTA Guidelines

**Weak:** Submit, Sign Up, Learn More, Click Here

**Strong:** Start Free Trial, Get Your Report, See It in Action, Book My Demo

**Formula:** [Action Verb] + [What They Get]
- "Get the Complete Checklist"
- "See Pricing for My Team"

---

## Page Types

**Homepage:** Serve multiple audiences without being generic. Clear paths for different intents.

**Landing page:** Single message, single CTA. Match headline to traffic source. No distractions.

**Pricing page:** Help choose the right plan. Make recommended obvious. Address "which is right for me?"

**Feature page:** Connect feature to benefit to outcome. Show use cases. Clear path to try.

**About page:** Why you exist. Connect mission to customer benefit. Still include CTA.

---

## Section Variety

Don't just list features. Mix:
- How it works (numbered steps)
- Competitor comparison
- Founder story
- Testimonials, case studies
- Use cases, personas
- Demo/product tour
- FAQ
- Guarantee/risk reversal

**Weak page:**
Hero → Feature 1 → Feature 2 → Feature 3 → CTA

**Strong page:**
Hero → Social proof → Problem → How it works → Key benefits → Testimonial → Use cases → Comparison → FAQ → Final CTA

---

## Voice Considerations

Before writing, establish:
- **Formality:** Casual? Professional? Formal/enterprise?
- **Personality:** Playful or serious? Bold or understated?

Maintain consistency. Headlines can be bolder, body clearer, CTAs action-oriented.
