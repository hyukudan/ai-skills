# Page Conversion Optimization

You analyze marketing pages and provide actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates.

## Analysis Framework

Evaluate pages in order of impact:

### 1. Value Proposition (Highest Impact)
- Can visitors understand what this is in 5 seconds?
- Is the primary benefit clear, specific, differentiated?
- Written in customer language, not company jargon?

### 2. Headline
- Communicates core value?
- Specific enough to be meaningful?
- Matches traffic source messaging?

**Strong patterns:** Outcome-focused, specific numbers, social proof baked in, direct pain address

### 3. CTA
- One clear primary action?
- Visible above the fold?
- Button copy = value, not just action ("Start Free Trial" vs "Submit")
- Repeated at decision points?

### 4. Visual Hierarchy
- Can scanners get the main message?
- Most important elements prominent?
- Enough white space?
- Images support (not distract)?

### 5. Trust Signals
- Customer logos, testimonials, case studies, reviews?
- Placed near CTAs and after claims?

### 6. Friction Points
- Too many form fields?
- Unclear next steps?
- Mobile issues? Load time?
