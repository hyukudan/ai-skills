# Popup Optimization

You create popups that convert without annoying users.

## Core Rules

**1. Timing determines reception**
- Too early = interruption
- Too late = missed
- Right time = helpful offer

**2. Value must justify interruption**
- Clear, immediate benefit
- Relevant to context
- Worth stopping for

**3. Respect the user**
- Easy to dismiss
- Remember preferences
- Don't trap or trick

---

## Trigger Strategies

**Exit intent:** Cursor moving to leave
- Best for: E-commerce, lead gen
- Mobile alternative: Back button, scroll up

**Scroll-based:** 25-50% depth
- Indicates engagement
- Best for: Blog, long-form content

**Time-delayed:** 30-60 seconds (not 5)
- Proven engagement first
- Best for: General visitors

**Click-triggered:** User initiates
- Zero annoyance
- Best for: Lead magnets, demos

**Page count:** After X pages
- Research/comparison behavior
- "Been comparing? Here's a summary..."

**Behavior-based:** Cart abandonment, pricing page visit, repeat visits

## Popup Types

### Email Capture
- Clear value (not just "Subscribe")
- Single field (email only)
- Consider incentive

### Lead Magnet
- Show preview of content
- Specific promise
- Minimal fields, instant delivery

### Discount/Promo
- Clear offer (10%, $20, free shipping)
- Deadline for urgency
- Easy to apply code

### Exit Intent
- Acknowledge leaving
- Different from entry offer
- Address objections
- "Wait! Before you go..." / "Forget something?"

### Slide-In
- Enters from corner
- Doesn't block content
- Good for chat, support, secondary CTAs

### Banner
- Top of page
- Single clear message
- Dismissable
- Time-limited

## Design Essentials

**Visual hierarchy:**
1. Headline (largest)
2. Value/offer
3. Form/CTA
4. Close option

**Sizing:** 400-600px wide, don't cover entire screen

**Close button:** Always visible (top right), large enough for mobile, click outside to close

**Mobile:**
- Bottom slide-ups work well
- Avoid full-screen overlays
- Larger touch targets

---

## Copy Formulas

**Headlines:**
- "Get [result] in [timeframe]"
- "Want [desired outcome]?"
- "Join [X] people who..."

**CTAs:**
- First person: "Get My Discount"
- Specific: "Send Me the Guide"
- Value-focused: "Claim My 10% Off"

**Decline:** Polite, not manipulative
- "No thanks" / "Maybe later"
- Avoid: "No, I don't want to save money"

---

## Frequency Rules

- Maximum once per session
- Remember dismissals (7-30 days)
- Exclude converted users
- Exclude recently dismissed

**Targeting:**
- New vs. returning (different needs)
- By traffic source (match message)
- By page type (context-relevant)

**Exclusions:** Checkout, conversion flows

---

## Compliance

**GDPR:** Clear consent, privacy link, don't pre-check

**Accessibility:** Keyboard nav (Tab, Enter, Esc), focus trap, screen reader compatible

**Google:** Intrusive interstitials hurt mobile SEO, avoid full-screen before content

---

## Measurement

**Metrics:**
- Conversion rate: Impressions → Submissions
- Close rate: Immediate dismissals
- Time to close

**Benchmarks:**
- Email popup: 2-5%
- Exit intent: 3-10%
- Click-triggered: 10%+

---

## By Business Type

**E-commerce:**
1. Entry/scroll: First-purchase discount
2. Exit intent: Bigger discount
3. Cart abandonment: Complete order reminder

**B2B SaaS:**
1. Click-triggered: Demos, lead magnets
2. Scroll: Newsletter
3. Exit intent: Trial or content offer

**Content/Media:**
1. Scroll: Newsletter after engagement
2. Page count: After multiple visits
3. Exit intent: Future content

## Psychology

**Zeigarnik:** "Continue where you left off"

**Reciprocity:** Give value first, then ask

**Scarcity:** "Limited time" (if genuine)
