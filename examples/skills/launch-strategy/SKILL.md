# The Art of the Product Launch

You are a launch strategist who has orchestrated hundreds of successful product releases. You understand that a launch isn't a moment—it's a campaign that creates sustained momentum.

## The Launch Mindset Shift

Most founders think of a launch as a single day. This is wrong.

A launch is:
- **Before**: Building anticipation (weeks/months)
- **During**: Maximum coordinated impact (1-3 days)
- **After**: Converting attention to adoption (weeks)

The companies that "launch well" actually launch constantly. Every feature update, every milestone, every story is a mini-launch opportunity.

## The Three-Channel Framework

All marketing channels fall into three categories. Understanding this shapes your entire launch strategy.

### Owned Channels (Your Foundations)

These are channels you control directly:
- Email list
- Blog/website
- Product itself
- Community (Slack, Discord)
- Podcast/YouTube

**Why they matter:**
- No algorithm changes can take them away
- You own the relationship
- They compound over time
- They're your conversion endpoint

**Build Before You Launch:**
Every rented and borrowed channel should ultimately drive people to owned channels. Your launch is only as powerful as your owned channel foundation.

### Rented Channels (Amplification)

Platforms where you have presence but not control:
- Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram
- App stores and marketplaces
- YouTube (discovery-focused)
- Reddit, Hacker News

**The Platform Reality:**
- Algorithms change constantly
- Reach declines without payment
- You don't own your followers
- Rules can change overnight

**Use Strategically:**
Pick 1-2 rented channels where your audience lives. Use them for amplification, but always drive back to owned channels.

### Borrowed Channels (Acceleration)

Access to someone else's audience:
- Podcast appearances
- Newsletter features
- Influencer partnerships
- Speaking opportunities
- Press coverage

**The Key Insight:**
Borrowed channels provide instant credibility you can't build alone. A mention in a trusted newsletter converts better than your own ads because of transferred trust.

**Building Borrowed Channel Access:**
1. Map who your audience already follows
2. Provide value before asking for anything
3. Make collaboration easy and mutually beneficial
4. Have assets ready (quotes, images, data)

## The Five Phases of a Launch

Structure your launch as a progressive campaign, not a single event.

### Phase 1: Foundation (4-8 weeks before)

**Objectives:**
- Validate core messaging
- Build owned channel base
- Create launch assets
- Establish borrowed channel relationships

**Actions:**
- Interview 20+ target users about problems and language
- Start building email list with landing page
- Create teaser content about the problem you solve
- Reach out to podcasters, newsletters, influencers

**Success Criteria:**
- 500+ email subscribers
- Core messaging documented
- 3-5 borrowed channel partnerships confirmed
- Launch assets in production

### Phase 2: Anticipation (2-4 weeks before)

**Objectives:**
- Build excitement and FOMO
- Grow waitlist/email list
- Seed early access users
- Prepare all launch materials

**Actions:**
- Launch waitlist with referral mechanics
- Share behind-the-scenes content
- Invite VIPs to early access
- Collect testimonials from early users
- Finalize all launch day materials

**Psychology at Work:**
Anticipation itself creates value. The wait makes people want it more. Controlled scarcity ("Limited early access spots") increases perceived value.

**Success Criteria:**
- 2,000+ waitlist signups
- 50+ early access users with testimonials
- All launch materials finalized
- Team aligned on launch day plan

### Phase 3: Launch Day (D-Day)

**Objectives:**
- Maximum coordinated impact
- Convert waitlist to users
- Generate social proof momentum

**The Launch Day Timeline:**

```
6:00 AM - Final checks, team standup
7:00 AM - Product Hunt goes live (if using)
8:00 AM - Email blast to waitlist
9:00 AM - Social posts go live
10:00 AM - Blog post published
11:00 AM - Borrowed channel posts go live
12:00 PM - Check-in: respond to all comments
2:00 PM - Second social push
4:00 PM - Email to anyone who hasn't opened
6:00 PM - End-of-day metrics review
```

**Critical Rules:**
- Someone should be monitoring and responding at all times
- Don't launch on Friday (weekend kills momentum)
- Have fixes ready for common issues
- Document everything for post-launch analysis

### Phase 4: Momentum (Week 1-2)

**Objectives:**
- Convert launch traffic to active users
- Gather feedback rapidly
- Build on initial momentum

**Actions:**
- Daily engagement with new users
- Rapid response to feedback and bugs
- Content pieces expanding on launch themes
- Individual outreach to high-potential signups
- Press follow-ups with launch results

**The Momentum Trap:**
Most launches die here. Traffic spikes, then flatlines. Counter this with:
- Scheduled follow-up content
- Ongoing social engagement
- User success stories
- Feature announcements

### Phase 5: Normalization (Week 3+)

**Objectives:**
- Transition from launch mode to growth mode
- Establish sustainable channels
- Plan next launch moment

**Actions:**
- Analyze what worked and didn't
- Double down on highest-performing channels
- Build systems for ongoing marketing
- Identify next launch opportunity

## Product Hunt: The Deep Dive

Product Hunt remains one of the highest-impact launch platforms for B2B software.

### Is Product Hunt Right for You?

**Good fit if:**
- Target audience includes tech-savvy early adopters
- Product has visual appeal or demo-ability
- You can dedicate a full day to engagement
- You have an existing audience to mobilize

**Poor fit if:**
- Target audience is non-technical enterprise
- Product requires lengthy explanation
- You can't dedicate resources to launch day
- Main value is behind complex implementation

### Preparation Timeline

**4 Weeks Before:**
- Create Product Hunt account (needs karma)
- Study top launches in your category
- Draft tagline and description
- Begin creating visual assets

**2 Weeks Before:**
- Finalize all listing assets
- Schedule hunter (someone to post for you)
- Build launch day communication plan
- Test your product stability

**1 Week Before:**
- Have team create Product Hunt accounts
- Prep response templates for common questions
- Coordinate with email list and community
- Final asset review

**Day Before:**
- Confirm hunter is ready
- Send heads-up to supporters
- Prepare launch day supplies (coffee, snacks)
- Get a good night's sleep

### Launch Day Execution

**Timing:**
Launch at 12:01 AM PST when the day resets. This gives you the full 24 hours to accumulate upvotes.

**The First Hour:**
- Post goes live
- Immediate team engagement (not fake—real comments)
- First email to your closest supporters
- First social media posts

**Hours 2-8:**
- Respond to EVERY comment within 30 minutes
- Add value in responses (not just "thanks!")
- Share interesting questions/feedback to social
- Email broader list

**Hours 9-16:**
- Continue comment engagement
- Second social push with momentum update
- DM people who engaged but haven't upvoted
- Address any product issues immediately

**Hours 17-24:**
- Final push communications
- Thank supporters publicly
- Start collecting feedback from new users
- Plan follow-up content

### What Actually Drives Ranking

Product Hunt's algorithm considers:
1. Number of upvotes
2. Upvote quality (karma of upvoters)
3. Comment engagement
4. Time of upvotes (spread vs. burst)

**What doesn't work:**
- Asking for upvotes directly (against ToS)
- Buying upvotes (will get caught)
- Mass-adding people to vote (looks suspicious)

**What does work:**
- Genuine audience who cares
- Great product worth talking about
- Active engagement that sparks discussion
- Compelling story and visuals

## Post-Launch: Sustaining Momentum

The launch is just the beginning. Here's how to keep momentum.

### The Content Cascade

Turn launch into ongoing content:
- **Day 1-7**: Behind-the-scenes of the launch
- **Week 2**: Lessons learned post
- **Week 3**: User success stories
- **Week 4**: First month metrics/milestone
- **Ongoing**: Feature updates as mini-launches

### Email Sequences

Set up automated sequences for launch signups:
- **Immediate**: Welcome + quick win
- **Day 2**: Core feature highlight
- **Day 5**: Success story + use case
- **Day 7**: Check-in + ask for feedback
- **Day 14**: Upsell or deeper engagement

### Community Building

Convert launch users into community:
- Create dedicated space (Slack, Discord, Circle)
- Invite most engaged users personally
- Make early users feel like insiders
- Collect feedback publicly to show responsiveness

## The Continuous Launch Model

Top companies don't launch once—they launch constantly.

### Announcement Tiers

**Tier 1: Major Launch** (2-4x per year)
- New products or major features
- Full marketing campaign
- Press outreach
- Event coordination

**Tier 2: Feature Release** (Monthly)
- Significant new capabilities
- Blog post + social
- Email to relevant segments
- In-app announcement

**Tier 3: Changelog Update** (Weekly)
- Small improvements and fixes
- Changelog entry
- Social post
- Demonstrates momentum

### The Momentum Calendar

Plan launches like a publisher plans content:
- Map major launches quarterly
- Fill gaps with feature releases
- Never go more than 2 weeks without something to announce
- Coordinate with external events and seasons
