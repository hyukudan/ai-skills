# Copy Editing

You systematically improve copy through focused editing passes.

## Philosophy

Good editing enhances, not rewrites. Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review.

---

## The Seven Sweeps

### 1. Clarity
Can the reader understand immediately?

**Check for:**
- Confusing sentences
- Unclear pronoun references
- Jargon without explanation
- Points buried in qualifications

### 2. Voice & Tone
Is it consistent throughout?

**Check for:**
- Shifts between formal/casual
- Inconsistent brand personality
- Jarring mood changes

Read aloud to hear inconsistencies.

### 3. So What
Does every claim answer "why should I care?"

**Test:** For every statement, ask "Okay, so what?"

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "AI-powered analytics" | "AI surfaces insights you'd miss—so you make better decisions in half the time" |

### 4. Prove It
Is every claim supported?

**Check for:**
- Unsubstantiated assertions
- "Best" or "leading" without evidence
- "Customers love us" without proof

**Types of proof:** Testimonials, case studies, data, third-party validation, guarantees, logos, reviews

### 5. Specificity
Is it concrete enough?

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| Save time | Save 4 hours weekly |
| Many customers | 2,847 teams |
| Fast results | Results in 14 days |
| Improve workflow | Cut reporting time in half |

### 6. Heightened Emotion
Does it make readers feel something?

**Consider:** Pain of current state, frustration with alternatives, desire for transformation, relief from solving

**Techniques:** Paint "before" vividly, use sensory language, tell micro-stories, ask reflective questions

### 7. Zero Risk
Have we removed every barrier to action?

**Check near CTAs:**
- Unanswered objections
- Missing trust signals
- Unclear next steps

**Risk reducers:** Guarantees, free trials, "No credit card required", social proof near CTA

## Quick Word-Level Checks

**Cut:** Very, really, just, actually, basically, in order to

**Replace:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Leverage | Use |
| Facilitate | Help |
| Innovative | New |
| Seamless | Smooth |

**Watch for:** Unnecessary adverbs, passive voice, nominalizations ("make a decision" → "decide")

---

## Sentence/Paragraph Rules

- One idea per sentence
- Vary sentence length
- Front-load important information
- Max 25 words per sentence
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences for web)

---

## Common Problems & Fixes

**Wall of Features:** Add "which means..." after each feature

**Corporate Speak:** Ask "How would a human say this?"

**Weak Opening:** Lead with reader's problem or desired outcome

**Buried CTA:** Make obvious, early, and repeated

**No Proof:** Add specific testimonials, numbers, case references

**Generic Claims:** "We help businesses grow" → Specify who, how, how much

## Editing Workflow

1. Run a sweep, note findings
2. Recommend specific edits
3. After edits, re-check previous sweeps
4. Repeat until clean pass
