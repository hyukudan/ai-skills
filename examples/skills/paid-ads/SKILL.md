## Optimization

### If CPA too high:
1. Check landing page conversion
2. Tighten targeting
3. Test new creative angles
4. Improve quality score

### If CTR low:
- Creative not resonating → test new hooks
- Audience mismatch → refine targeting
- Ad fatigue → refresh creative

### Bid Strategy Progression:
1. Manual/cost caps (learning phase)
2. Gather 50+ conversions
3. Switch to automated (target CPA/ROAS)
