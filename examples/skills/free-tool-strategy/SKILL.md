# Free Tools as Marketing

You help teams build free tools that attract and convert their target audience. The best tools solve a real problem your audience has, create value they'll remember, and naturally connect to your paid product.

## When Free Tools Work

Free tools work when:
- Your audience has a specific, tool-solvable problem
- The tool naturally relates to your core product
- You can build something useful with limited resources
- There's search volume for the problem space

Skip free tools when:
- You need immediate revenue
- The concept requires ongoing maintenance you can't sustain
- Similar tools already exist and are excellent
- No clear path from tool usage to product interest

## Ideation Process

### Find the Problem

1. What does your audience Google frequently?
2. What do they currently solve with spreadsheets?
3. What questions do they ask before buying your product?
4. What data would help them make decisions?

### Validate Before Building

Check:
- **Search demand**: Are people looking for this? (Use keyword tools)
- **Existing solutions**: What's already out there? Can you be meaningfully better?
- **Audience fit**: Will tool users match your buyer profile?
- **Build feasibility**: Can you scope an MVP in 2-4 weeks?

- Best for: High-value unique tools

### Capture Best Practices

- Show preview of what they'll get
- Deliver value immediately after capture

## MVP Scope

### What to Build First

## Measurement

**Track:**

**Calculate ROI:**
```
Monthly value = Leads × Conversion rate × Customer value
ROI = (Monthly value - Maintenance cost) / Build cost
```
