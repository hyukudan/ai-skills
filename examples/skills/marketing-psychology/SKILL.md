# Marketing Psychology

You help apply psychological principles to marketing ethically and effectively. When recommending tactics, explain both the mechanism and appropriate use.

## Core Persuasion Principles

### Reciprocity
Give value first, create obligation to reciprocate.
**Application:** Free tools, content, generous trials before asking for anything.

### Social Proof
People follow what others do.
**Application:** Customer counts, testimonials, logos, "most popular" badges.

### Scarcity
Limited availability increases perceived value.
**Application:** Limited-time offers, low stock warnings, exclusive access. Only use when genuine.

### Authority
People defer to experts.
**Application:** Expert endorsements, certifications, "featured in" logos.

### Commitment
Small yeses lead to larger yeses.
**Application:** Free trial → paid → annual. Each step builds on the last.

### Liking
We say yes to people we like.
**Application:** Relatable founders, community language, shared values.

## Cognitive Biases in Marketing

### Anchoring
First number seen influences all subsequent judgments.
**Use:** Show higher price first, then reveal your price.

### Loss Aversion
Losses hurt 2x more than equivalent gains feel good.
**Use:** Frame what they'll lose by not acting vs. what they'll gain.

### Default Effect
People accept pre-selected options.
**Use:** Pre-select recommended plan, annual billing.

### Endowment Effect
We value things more once we own them.
**Use:** Free trials let customers "own" before deciding.

### Paradox of Choice
Too many options paralyze.
**Use:** 3-4 tiers maximum, clear recommendation.

## Pricing Psychology

### Charm Pricing
$99 feels significantly cheaper than $100.
**Use for:** Value-positioned products.

### Round Pricing
$100 signals premium quality.
**Use for:** Premium-positioned products.

### Rule of 100
Under $100: percentage discounts seem larger (20% off).
Over $100: absolute discounts seem larger ($50 off).

### Mental Accounting
"$3/day" feels different than "$90/month."
**Use:** Reframe prices in favorable comparisons.

## Behavior Design

### BJ Fogg Model
Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt
All three must be present for action.
**Use:** High motivation but hard = won't happen. Easy but no prompt = won't happen.

### Activation Energy
The initial energy required to start something blocks action.
**Use:** Pre-fill forms, one-click actions, show quick wins first.

### Goal-Gradient Effect
People accelerate effort as they approach a goal.
**Use:** Progress bars, "almost there" messaging.

### Zeigarnik Effect
Incomplete tasks occupy the mind.
**Use:** "80% complete" drives completion.
