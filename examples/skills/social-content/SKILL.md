# Social Content Strategy

You create engaging content that builds audience and drives results.

## Platform Quick Guide

### LinkedIn
**Best for:** B2B, thought leadership, professional networking
**Frequency:** 3-5x/week
**What works:** Personal stories with business lessons, contrarian takes, behind-the-scenes, carousels
**Tips:** First line is everything, links in comments not post, 1,200-1,500 chars performs well

### Twitter/X
**Best for:** Tech, real-time commentary, niche communities
**Frequency:** 3-10x/day including replies
**What works:** Hot takes, teaching threads, engaging with others, memes
**Tips:** Under 100 chars = more engagement, quote tweets beat plain RTs

### Instagram
**Best for:** Visual brands, lifestyle, e-commerce
**Frequency:** 1-2 feed posts/day, 3-10 Stories
**What works:** Reels (2x reach of static), carousels, interactive Stories
**Tips:** First frame hooks, use all Story features

### TikTok
**Best for:** Brand awareness, younger audiences, viral potential
**Frequency:** 1-4x/day
**What works:** Native unpolished content, trending sounds, educational-as-entertainment
**Tips:** Hook in first 1-2 seconds, under 30 seconds, vertical only

| Industry insights | 30% | Trends, data, predictions |
| Behind-the-scenes | 25% | Building, lessons learned |
| Educational | 25% | How-tos, frameworks |
| Personal | 15% | Stories, values, hot takes |
| Promotional | 5% | Product updates, offers |

## Hook Formulas

**Curiosity:**
- "I was wrong about [common belief]."
- "The real reason [outcome] happens isn't what you think."
- "Nobody talks about [insider knowledge]."

**Story:**
- "Last week, [unexpected thing] happened."
- "I almost [big mistake]."
- "3 years ago, I [past state]. Today, [current state]."

**Value:**
- "How to [outcome] (without [pain]):"
- "[Number] [things] that [outcome]:"
- "Stop [mistake]. Do this instead:"

**Contrarian:**
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold statement]"
- "[Common advice] is wrong. Here's why:"

## Post Templates

```
[Hook: Unexpected outcome]

[Set scene]

[Challenge faced]

[What happened]

[Turning point]

[Result]

[Lesson for readers]

[Question to engage]
```

### LinkedIn List
```
X things I learned about [topic]:

1. [Point] — [Brief explanation]
2. [Point] — [Brief explanation]
3. [Point] — [Brief explanation]

Which resonates most?
```

### Twitter Thread

## Repurposing System

**Blog → Social:**
- LinkedIn: Key insight + link in comments
- LinkedIn: Carousel of main points
- Twitter: Thread of takeaways
- Instagram: Carousel with visuals, Reel summary

**Video/Podcast → Social:**
- LinkedIn: Quote graphic
- Twitter: Thread of best quotes
- Instagram/TikTok: Short clips

---

## Engagement Strategy

**Daily routine (30 min):**
1. Respond to all comments (5 min)
2. Comment on 5-10 target accounts (15 min)
3. Share with insight (5 min)
4. Send 2-3 DMs (5 min)

**Quality comments:** Add insight, share experience, ask thoughtful questions (not "Great post!")

---

## Algorithm Tips

**LinkedIn:** First hour matters, comments > reactions, no links in post body

**Twitter:** Replies build authority, threads rewarded, first 30 min matters

**Instagram:** Reels prioritized, saves/shares > likes, use all features

---

## Weekly Batching

1. Review content pillars
2. Write 5 LinkedIn posts
3. Write 3 Twitter threads + daily tweets
4. Create Instagram carousel + Reel ideas
5. Schedule everything
6. Leave room for real-time

---

## Metrics That Matter

**Awareness:** Impressions, reach, follower growth

**Engagement:** Engagement rate, comments (high value), shares/saves

**Conversion:** Link clicks, profile visits, DMs, leads attributed
